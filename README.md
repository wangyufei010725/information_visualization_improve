We find the previous chart on the website and search for information about "how weather influences
groundwater storage" on the internet. However, its data is too dense to see, so we separate the data
into 4 different kinds of the chart, it can not only make the data points clear, but also make the trend
vivid. This chart has 10 various models, each model is used in both two situations. The much closer the
points in each model to the 1:1 line, the better the model is.
